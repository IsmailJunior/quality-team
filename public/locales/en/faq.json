	"firstQuiz": "How long are the links guaranteed for?",
	"secondQuiz": "What’s the minimum order?",
	"thirdQuiz": "Do you use Social Media Influencers?",
	"fourthQuiz": "Can I choose the content and/or review the articles beforehand?",
	"fifthQuiz": "Do you pay the bloggers?",
	"sixthQuiz": "What’s the turnaround time?",
	"firstAnswr": "We guarantee them for 12 months. There’s no reason why it shouldn’t be “forever.” But we can’t have people coming back to us in 3 years asking for a refund because someone decided to shut down their business. So, 12 months seem reasonable.",
	"secondAnswr": "You can place orders as few or as many as you want",
	"thirdAnswr": "We personally don’t own work with third party companies, But we have our set of models.",
	"fourthAnswr": "Yes you can, and for new clients we will often send some samples as part of the onboarding of what we are thinking. However as the relationship develops, in general, we try to focus on delivering the content without review because it interrupts the flow and slows down delivery.",
	"fifthAnswr": "On occasion, yes. Some bloggers request money for the time it takes to review the article and post it, which in our opinion is fair. This is not disclosed in the article.",
	"sixthAnswr": "For a standard order of around 5-10 links our goal is around 4 weeks. Occasionally for larger orders (20+), or when a client has been with us for some time, it can take a bit of extra time. But links are updated in real-time and in most cases the remaining part of the order is at least in progress. "
