	"secondQuiz": "What’s the minimum order?",
	"thirdQuiz": "Do you use PBNs?",
	"fourthQuiz": "Can I choose the websites and/or review the articles beforehand?",
	"fifthQuiz": "Do you pay the bloggers?",
	"sixthQuiz": "What’s the turnaround time?",
	"firstAnswr": "We guarantee them for 12 months. There’s no reason why it shouldn’t be “forever.” But we can’t have people coming back to us in 3 years asking for a refund because someone decided to shut down their site. So, 12 months seem reasonable.",
	"secondAnswr": "You can order as few or as many as you want",
	"thirdAnswr": "We personally don’t own any sites that we work with. Our standards are designed to weed out low quality websites, PBNs, etc. Regardless, we cannot guarantee that the site is not somebody’s PBN, as that’s very hard to tell.",
	"fourthAnswr": "Yes you can, and for new clients we will often send some samples as part of the onboarding of what we are thinking. However as the relationship develops, in general, we try to focus on delivering the links without review because it interrupts the flow and slows down delivery. Of course, if you don’t like a site, then we will simply replace it. ",
	"fifthAnswr": "On occasion, yes. Some bloggers request money for the time it takes to review the article and post it, which in our opinion is fair. This is not disclosed in the article.",
	"sixthAnswr": "For a standard order of around 5-10 links our goal is around 4 weeks. Occasionally for larger orders (20+), or when a client has been with us for some time, it can take a bit of extra time. But links are updated in real-time and in most cases the remaining part of the order is at least in progress. "
